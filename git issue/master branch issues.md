Thank you for the hint about the default branch name. Starting from Git version 2.28, the default branch name has been changed from 'master' to a more inclusive and neutral name, such as 'main', 'trunk', or 'development'. This change is to promote inclusivity and eliminate any historical associations with the term 'master'.

To set the default branch name for all your new repositories and suppress the warning, you can use the following command:

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
```

Replace `<name>` with the desired default branch name you prefer, such as 'main', 'trunk', or 'development'.

For example, if you want to set 'main' as the default branch name, use:

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

You can also rename the just-created branch in your local repository using the following command:

```bash
git branch -m <new-branch-name>
```

Replace `<new-branch-name>` with the desired name for the branch.

Keep in mind that this hint is to encourage the use of more inclusive default branch names and to promote a welcoming environment for all contributors. It is recommended to adopt this practice in your future projects.
